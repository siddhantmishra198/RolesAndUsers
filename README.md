# RolesAndUsers
I have written the program on RolesAndUsers or Role Hierarchy using Python programming language.
At first it will ask to choose the root role name.
Then it will give 10 options to the user like 
        1. Add Sub Role
        2. Display Roles
        3. Delete Role
        4. Add User
        5. Display Users
        6. Display Users and Sub Users
        7. Delete User
        8. Number of users from top
        9. Height of role hierarchy
        10.Common boss of users
The user has to choose a option between 1 to 10.
As per the user selection ,the program will give him the output.
1. Add Sub Role:
    It is used to add sub role in the role hierarchy.
2. Display Roles:
    It will display the roles and sub-roles added by the user.
3. Delete Role:
    This option allows the user to delete a role and transform that deleted role to another role.
4. Add User:
    By using this the user can provide a user name to the roles.
5. Display Users:
    This will display the user name along with the roles.
6. Display Users and Sub Users:
    It will display the role and along with the sub-role working under that role.
7. Delete User:
    If the user want to delete a user ,it can provide the user-name in this option.
8. Number of users from top:
    It will ask for a user name and give output the number of user working above him.
9. Height of role hierarchy:
    It will give the height of the heirarchy.
10.Common boss of users:
    It will ask for 2 user name and provide the common user of both the users.
